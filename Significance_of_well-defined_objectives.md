### Importance of clear objectives : 

If an action gets us closer to our objectives, it is significant; if it does not, it is unimportant. If our goals are clearly defined and prioritized, they may help us succeed while also allowing us to have fun.

### Things that do not matter

If a task does not contribute to either enjoying or achieving, it is unimportant, and we want to spend as little time as possible on it so that we may devote more time to the things we do want to accomplish or enjoy.
