### Importance of clear objectives : 

If an action gets us closer to our objectives, it is significant; if it does not, it is unimportant. If our goals are clearly defined and prioritized, they may help us succeed while also allowing us to have fun.

### Things that do not matter

If a task does not contribute to either enjoying or achieving, it is unimportant, and we want to spend as little time as possible on it so that we may devote more time to the things we do want to accomplish or enjoy.

### Enjoy & Achieve : 

The best way to use our time is to enjoy and achieve at both home and work. In actuality, since time is all we have, it is the best use of our time. That is the ultimate goal of life: to achieve and to enjoy, since all we have is the present and the future, and the present is about enjoying and the future is about achieving. We can learn from the past, but we can't change it. So we just have the present and the future to appreciate and accomplish.
